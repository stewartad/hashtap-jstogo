This is an Electron app built using [astilectron](https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron), made with the help of [the demo](https://medium.com/@social_57971/how-to-add-a-gui-to-your-golang-app-in-5-easy-steps-c25c99d4d8e0), to communicate with the Hedera Hashgraph API for their HackArizona micropayment challenge. 

HashTap is a proof of concept for distributed ledger technology. The idea is to monetize fluid dispensers on a per-ounce basis and charge the customer's cryptocurrency wallet in realtime. This will allow not only soda fountains, bar taps, and other beverages to be dispensed on-demand without the need of an attendant, but could be used for any good sold in small units.
