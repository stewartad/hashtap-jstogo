# HashTap

This is an Electron app built using [astilectron](https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron), made with the help of [the demo](https://medium.com/@social_57971/how-to-add-a-gui-to-your-golang-app-in-5-easy-steps-c25c99d4d8e0), to communicate with the Hedera Hashgraph API for their HackArizona micropayment challenge. The app simulates a beverage fountain that charges a customer in real time by unit volume using their cryptocurrency wallet. 

HashTap is a proof of concept for distributed ledger technology. The idea is to monetize fluid dispensers on a per-ounce basis and charge the customer's cryptocurrency wallet in realtime. This will allow not only soda fountains, bar taps, and other beverages to be dispensed on-demand without the need of an attendant, but could be used for any goods sold in small units. Overall, this allows for higher productivity in customer service and foodservice by freeing up hands around the workplace.
